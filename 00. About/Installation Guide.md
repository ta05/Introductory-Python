# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing the Python3 interpreter and the program we will be using to actually write code (the IDE).


## Installing Python3

* Go to the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website.
    * If you have Windows, click the yellow "Download Python" button.
    * If you have a different OS, under "Looking for Python with a different OS", click the appropriate OS. Then click the link for the "Latest Python 3 Release"

* Open the Python installation package in your file explorer and follow the installation instructions.


## Downloading the IDE

You have plenty of choices when it comes to the program you would like to use for writing Python code. Below are just a few of these options. The instructions will help you download and setup your IDE.

### PyCharm

    * Go to the directory where PyCharm is located and start the application. The first time you open PyCharm you will be presented with a window.
    * Select "Create New Project".
    * Under Location, change "untitled1" to "Hello World". Keep the rest of the file path the same.
    * Under Interpreter, the interpreter should match the version of Python3 that you installed. If not select the matching version from the dropdown.

### Visual Studio Code

- Installation
    * Go to the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website.
        * If you have Windows, click the "Download for Windows" button.

    * Leave "Launch Visual Studio Code" checked and click "Finish".

- Setup
    * Go to the directory where VSCode is located and open the application.
    * On the left sidebar, you will see an icon with four squares. This is the Extensions button. Click it.
    * Type "Python" into the search bar and select the first result. Click "Install" underneath the Python extension's description.
    * Once the extension has been installed, check the bottom left corner of the VSCode window. You should see the Python3 interpreter version that you installed
